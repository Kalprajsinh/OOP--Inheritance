The capability of a class to derive properties
and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.

Derived Class: The class that inherits properties 
               from another class is called Subclass or Derived Class. 
Base Class: The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass 
            is called Base Class or Superclass. 


** Types Of Inheritance

=> Single inheritance  :-    
                                [ Base class ]
                                      ⇓
                               [ Derived class ]
                              
=> Multiple inheritance :-  

                   [ Base class 1]     [ Base class 2 ]
                           ⇘                 ⇙
                            [ Derived class ]

=> Multilevel inheritance  :-     

                               [ Base class ]
                                     ⇓
                            [ intermediate class ]
                                     ⇓
                                [ Sub class ]

=> Hierarchical inheritance :-

                             [one Base class ] 
                             ⇙               ⇘               
                 [ Derived class 1 ]      [ Derived class 2 ]


=> Hybrid inheritance :- 

                            [ Base class ] 
                           ⇙             ⇘   
             [ Derived class 1 ]      [ Derived class 2 ] 
                           ⇘              ⇙
                          [ Derived class 3 ]
