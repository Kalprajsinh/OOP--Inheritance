Inheritance :- The capability of a class to derive properties
             and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.

Derived Class:- The class that inherits properties 
               from another class is called Subclass or Derived Class.
               
Base Class:- The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass 
            is called Base Class or Superclass. 
            
 Syntax: 

 class  <derived_class_name> : <access-specifier> <base_class_name>
 {
        //body
 }
 
class — keyword to create a new class
derived_class_name   —  name of the new class, which will inherit the base class
access-specifier  — either of private, public or protected. If neither is specified, PRIVATE is taken as default
base-class-name  — name of the base class

Example of access specifier:

=> class ABC : private XYZ                //private derivation
            {                }
=> class ABC : public XYZ                 //public derivation
            {               }
=> class ABC : protected XYZ              //protected derivation
            {              }
=> class ABC: XYZ                        //private derivation by default
{            }


** "Types Of Inheritance" 


1. Single inheritance  :-    
                                [ Base class ]
                                      ⇓
                               [ Derived class ]
                              
2. Multiple inheritance :-  

                   [ Base class 1]     [ Base class 2 ]
                           ⇘                 ⇙
                            [ Derived class ]

3. Multilevel inheritance  :-     

                               [ Base class ]
                                     ⇓
                            [ intermediate class ]
                                     ⇓
                                [ Sub class ]

4. Hierarchical inheritance :-

                             [one Base class ] 
                             ⇙               ⇘               
                 [ Derived class 1 ]      [ Derived class 2 ]


5. Hybrid inheritance :- 

                            [ Base class ] 
                           ⇙             ⇘   
             [ Derived class 1 ]      [ Derived class 2 ] 
                           ⇘              ⇙
                          [ Derived class 3 ]
